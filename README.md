# Tumaris Personal Website (Next.js)

This is my first ever personal website project, built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and styled using [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/). The website showcases my interests, including my love for cats and reading, and serves as a creative way to explore modern web development tools.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
